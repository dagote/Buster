# Bitcino Protocol

A decentralized P2P betting protocol on Polygon. Open source, forkable, and deployable by anyone.

---

## Layer 1: Smart Contract (Polygon)

The protocol core. The only component that defines the standard.

- Accepts bets from two players
- Holds funds in escrow
- Receives winner decision from server
- Pays out 99% to winner, 1% to deployer
- All transactions auditable on chain
- Open source — anyone can deploy their own instance and take their own 1%

---

## Layer 2: Server (Python)

The game brain. Sits between the frontend and the contract.

- Player matchmaking — pairs two players together
- Game logic — dice, slots, match-3
- Randomness generation and verification
- Sends winner result to smart contract
- REST API for frontend communication

---

## Layer 3: Frontend

The player experience. Independent of the protocol — anyone can build their own.

- MetaMask wallet connection
- Game UI
- Bet initiation and confirmation
- Displays results and payouts

---

## Player Flow

```
Player connects wallet
        ↓
Places bet (funds go to contract)
        ↓
Server matches with opponent
        ↓
Game runs on server
        ↓
Server sends winner to contract
        ↓
Contract pays out automatically
```

## Protocol Principles

- You never hold user funds — the contract does
- The contract is the source of truth
- The server layer can be replaced by anyone
- The frontend layer can be replaced by anyone
- Only the contract is the protocol

## Protocol Goals

- Open standard anyone can fork and deploy in one session
- Deployer takes 1% of every settled bet automatically
- No custodial risk — funds held by contract, not operator
- Chain agnostic across all EVM networks
