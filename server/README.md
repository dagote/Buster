# Server Examples (Future)

This folder will contain reference server implementations that use the
protocol core to provide matchmaking, game logic, and randomness
coordination.  At Phase 2 the Python backend will live here; later we may
add JavaScript/TypeScript examples.

For now it is empty – the protocol itself is self-contained in
`/protocol`.
